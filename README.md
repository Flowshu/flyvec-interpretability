# Comparing Interpretability of Biologically Inspired and Traditional Word Embeddings

This repository contains the code for the paper "Comparing Interpretability of Biologically Inspired and Traditional Word Embeddings".  
We worked on this project during the seminar of the Bio-inspired Artificial Intelligence (BAI) course at the University of Hamburg in the winter semester 2021/2022.  
The main research questions in this seminar project was about the interpretability of the [FlyVec](https://github.com/bhoov/flyvec) word embeddings by Liang et al. [1].  
We evaluated the interpretability of FlyVec [1] on the following two metrics and compared it with traditional word embeddings (like word2vec [2], GloVe [3], and BERT [4]).

## Interpretability Score

`InterpretabilityScore.ipynb` contains experiments to evaluate the interpretability for different word embedding techniques with the interpretability score on the [SEMCAT](https://github.com/avaapm/SEMCATdataset2018) dataset introduced by Şenel et al. [5].

## Semantic and Syntactic Relationships

`Relationships.ipynb` contains experiments to evaluate the interpretability for different word embedding techniques on the semantic and syntactic relationships dataset by Mikolov et al. [2].
